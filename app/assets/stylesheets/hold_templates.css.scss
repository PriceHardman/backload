//We want the CSS to behave differently depending on whether we're showing a template record or editing it's selectable cells,
//so in the _hold_grid.html.erb, the table has a data-action tag containing the action associated with the view.
//This will allow us to

#grid_container {
  height: "100%";
  width: "100%";
  position: absolute;

  image {
    position: absolute;
  }

  table {
    position:  absolute;
  }
}

.hover {
  background-color: rgba(255,255,0,0.4); //translucent yellow if hovered over
}

.selected {
  background-color: rgba(0,255,0,0.5); //translucent green if selected
}
